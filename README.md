# Skill-Squatting

The project work on “Evaluating Skill Squatting Attack on Amazon Alexa” deals with the analysis of
Amazon Alexa in the way it behaves differently on similar sounding voice commands. The research work
on the topic is included in the 27th USENIX Security Symposium conducted by University of Illinois. The
research work primarily focuses on the empirical analysis of interpretation errors made by Amazon
Alexa’s speech recognition system which is the powerhouse of all the Amazon Echo devices.

The evaluation of the attacks done in the scope of this project is limited to the audio samples taken from
five individuals and we maintain the ethical considerations of the same. In the first part of the project
work we verify the results concluded in the research paper. We performed the skill squatting on existing
skills in the amazon skill store and building pair of skills with the names that are frequently confused by
Alexa. We experienced some deviations in the results as compared to that in the research paper. We
thus concluded that Alexa speech recognition is still ambiguous and unpredictable.

We further the work on Skill Squatting by contributing to real world case scenario by performing skill
squatting on American Express skills. The findings on the same shows the security implications related to
Amazon Alexa. The possibility of the attack is discussed by establishing two threat models which
summaries our novel conclusion.
